            <h2>EV Cars Taking Over</h2>
            <p>Electric cars are slowing starting to take over the roads. With Tesla gaining popularity exponentially over the past five to ten years, every other car brand wants to start making electric cars now too. For example, some of the brands that plan to switch to fully electric cars are as follows Jaguar, Alfa Romeo, Lotus, Bentley, Cadillac, Lexus, Mercedes Benz and Mini. They are planning to do this by 2030 and soon other brands will follow as well. Now, I understand why they are doing this (to be environmentally conscious and appeal to more people) but, it is upsetting. As someone who truly loves a good gas-powered engine for the sound and nostalgia, its crazy to me that these brands want to go fully electric. Soon our kids and our grandchildren wont even be able to buy a gas-powered car from a dealership which is a crazy thought to me. There are so many cool gas-powered cars that we will have to say goodbye to. Even my favorite car ever is gas powered, a Porsche GT3 RS, and I’m not sure they will still be making them by the time I would be able to buy one. That is why this is so upsetting and shocking to me. I estimate by 2050, more than ninety percent of the cars on the road will be electric. What do you think?  </p>

            <h2>My Favorite Television Shows</h2>
            <p>A favorite television show is a tricky subject to dig into. In my opinion it takes multiple factors in order to call a show my favorite. For example, one of the main factors is if I could rewatch the show multiple times and still get the same enjoyment out of it that I got the first time. A lot of people don’t like to rewatch their favorite shows but I think it’s cool because often you notice things that you didn’t notice the first time watching it. This is the biggest tell tale in if a show is considered one of my favorites. Another factor is if the show is timeless. What I mean by this is could I watch the show now and then rewatch it say five years later and it still be just as relevant? Lastly, a big factor to me is if I would tell other people to watch it. If I really like a show then I want all my friends to at least try it and see if they like it as well. With all these factors in mind, some of my favorite shows ever are The Office, Breaking Bad, Prison Break, and Narcos. With all of these shows I would be willing to rewatch them (most of them I have numerous times), I think they are timeless, and I try to get my friends to watch them all the time. Although, if I had to pick a number one it would be a split decision between the office and prison break. I also put the office on in the background when I’m doing things or late at night and, whenever I rewatch prison break I find myself binging it. </p>
