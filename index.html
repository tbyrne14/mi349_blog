            <h2>EV Cars Taking Over</h2>
            <p>Electric cars are slowing starting to take over the roads. With Tesla gaining popularity exponentially over the past five to ten years, every other car brand wants to start making electric cars now too. For example, some of the brands that plan to switch to fully electric cars are as follows Jaguar, Alfa Romeo, Lotus, Bentley, Cadillac, Lexus, Mercedes Benz and Mini. They are planning to do this by 2030 and soon other brands will follow as well. Now, I understand why they are doing this (to be environmentally conscious and appeal to more people) but, it is upsetting. As someone who truly loves a good gas-powered engine for the sound and nostalgia, its crazy to me that these brands want to go fully electric. Soon our kids and our grandchildren wont even be able to buy a gas-powered car from a dealership which is a crazy thought to me. There are so many cool gas-powered cars that we will have to say goodbye to. Even my favorite car ever is gas powered, a Porsche GT3 RS, and Iâ€™m not sure they will still be making them by the time I would be able to buy one. That is why this is so upsetting and shocking to me. I estimate by 2050, more than ninety percent of the cars on the road will be electric. What do you think?  </p>
