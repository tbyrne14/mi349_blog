        <h2>Bio</h2>  
        <p>My name is Tyler Byrne and I am a 22-year-old Senior at Michigan State University. Ever since I was a little kid, I wanted to attend Michigan State so it feels like a blessing to be getting my degree from here. I am getting my undergraduate degree in information science. I’m hoping that this degree will lead me into the field of cybersecurity with all the knowledge I’ll need to have a nice career. A little bit about me is I enjoy spending time with my group of friends both on campus and off campus. I used to play lacrosse in high school and now I always find myself playing golf or basketball if the weather is nice enough. Some of the things that I am into would be art, cars, fashion, technology, and gaming. Below is a list of all my favorite games currently. Originally, I am from Macomb Township, Michigan but I’ve really grown to like living in East Lansing while I’ve been at Michigan State. Thanks for getting to know me a little bit by reading my bio!</p>
